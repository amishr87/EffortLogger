# EffortLogger

EffortLogger is a software tool specifically designed to capture a week’s worth of effort and defect information for up to three different projects. The tool will record project names, life cycles, and deliverable definitions, so as to accurately determine how developers spend their time. 

The software shows different versions of the interface based on the entered employee token.
